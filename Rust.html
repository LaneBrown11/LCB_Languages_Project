Rust is a relatively new language that focuses on reliability and safety. It's known to<br> provide <strong>strong</strong> memory safety, good performance, and low level control. It can be compared <br>to C and C++, providing low level control, but unlike these older languages, Rust is far less <br>prone to crashes, bugs, and security threats. It is commonly used to build kernels, drivers, and other<br> components where memory is a crucial aspect.
