<h1>LISP</h1><p>

<h3>Basic Information</h3><p>
Created by John McCarthy at Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1959<p>
Considered the oldest functional language, it was first utilized on an IBM 704 computer. It is <br>considered very effective  for use in artificial intelligence programs due to its ability to process<br> symbolic information. Lisp has gone through a large number of dialects through the decades, but<br> in the 1980s, Common Lisp was created as a way to unify the different dialects to streamline the<br> use of the language. Today, Lisp is still valuable, particularly with AI programming, which is becoming<br> increasingly more valuable. Lisp is also used for natural language processing, the ability for computers to<br> interpret human language<br>
